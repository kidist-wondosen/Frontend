<p id="kk">My name is Kidist Wondosen.I am 20 years old.I live in Ethiopia.I was born in a family and an environment that believe in hard work and kindness is key for everything.I am currently learning Full Stack Developing by the help of Dot Jordan Teams.I am hoping that after I finish this program to become a full stacker.The knowledge of Full Stack will help me in the goal I have planned out since I am also majoring in Computer Science it will be a great addition.In five years from now I want to be one of the people that makes a difference in technology. </p>
